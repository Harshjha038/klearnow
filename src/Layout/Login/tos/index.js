<b>3	RESTRICTIONS ON USE</b> <br/>
3.1	Service Provider Information Approval Process. Service Provider shall submit information regarding Service Provider and the Services offered by Service Provider to KN for its review and approval for listing on the Exchange.  KN reserves the right, in its sole discretion and for any reason at any time, to refuse approval of any information submitted by Service Provider and/or to remove all information regarding Service Provider from the Exchange.  KN may adopt any review standards, policies and practices with respect to the evaluation and approval of information regarding custom brokers and End Users that is included on the Exchange, and may change such standards, policies and practices, in its sole discretion.  Service Provider shall comply with all such policies and practices.  KN reserves the right to re-evaluate any previously-approved Service Provider information set forth on the Exchange in connection with updates to its review and approval standards, policies and practices.  KN’s approval of information regarding Service Provider for listing on the Exchange shall not be deemed an endorsement by KN of the Service Provider or of Service Provider’s Content, products or services.  Service Provider acknowledges that Service Provider is solely responsible for, and that KN has no responsibility or liability whatsoever for, the performance of Service Provider’s services to End Users or for any interaction between Service Provider and any End User.  Service Provider further represents that Service Provider shall be solely responsible for the accuracy, legality, and appropriateness of any Content or information Service Provider submits to KN, or makes available on or through, the Exchange.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Service Provider agrees to maintain all licenses and permits required by applicable law in order to perform services on behalf of End Users and agrees that all information regarding its licensure and permits set forth on the Exchange is, and shall at all times be, true and correct in all respects. <br/>
3.2	Service Provider’s Access. KN may terminate this Agreement and suspend Service Provider’s access to the Exchange for any reason or for no reason.  Service Provider is responsible for all activities that occur between Service Provider and End User.  Service Provider shall at all times during the term of this Agreement comply with all applicable laws.<br/>
3.3	Restrictions on Use. Unless otherwise authorized under this Agreement, Service Provider may not and will not allow any third party to: (i)  exploit or cause the exploitation of the Exchange or Content provided by KN in any unauthorized way, including but not limited to trespass, burdening network capacity or using the Exchange or KN’s Content other than for purposes authorized herein; (ii) sell, rent, lease, license, sublicense, distribute, make available, pledge, assign or otherwise transfer in whole or in part KN’s Content or access to the Exchange to another party; (iii) provide, disclose, divulge or make available to, or permit use of KN’s Content in whole or in part by any third party without KN’s prior written consent; (iv) modify, translate, adapt or create derivative works based on KN’s Content or the Exchange; (v) decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer (except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, notwithstanding a contractual obligation to the contrary) the Platform (including the Exchange) or KN’s Content, or any portion thereof; (vi) use the Platform or the Exchange in any way that is contrary to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (vii) use the Platform or the Exchange to send or store any code, files, scripts, agents or programs intended to do harm, including, but not limited to, viruses, worms, time bombs and Trojan horses; (viii) use the Platform or the Exchange to store, publish or transmit infringing, libelous, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material, or to store, publish or transmit materials in violation of third party privacy or confidentiality rights; (ix) use the Platform or the Exchange in any way that violates the privacy rights of any End User or other Person; (x) use the Platform, the Exchange or any Content for any unlawful purposes; or (xi) share user IDs, passwords, or other account information with anyone other than Service Provider’s authorized representatives. <br/>
3.4	Contacts Outside the Exchange.  If KN believes Service Provider is violating the policy on Contacts Outside the Exchange (considered if/when Carrier engages in a direct commercial relationship with customer or customers introduced on the platform for which they had no previous relatioship), Service Provider may be subject to a range of actions, including limits on Service Provider’s privileges to use the Platform and the Exchange, restrictions on listings and account features, suspension of Service Provider’s account, application of fees, and recovery of expenses for policy monitoring and enforcement.  In addition, Service Provider’s violation of this Section 3.4 and/or the policy on Contacts Outside the Exchange would cause KN significant harm.  KN has devoted significant time and expense to develop and maintain the Platform and the Exchange and, therefore, Service Provider’s violation of Section 3.4 and/or the policy on Contracts Outside the Exchange would cause KN significant harm.  Since the Parties agree it is impractical to calculate, or difficult to ascertain the actual damages resulting from a breach of the obligations in Section 3.4, if Service Provider breaches this Section 3.4 and/or the policy on Contacts Outside the Exchange (as determined by KN in its sole discretion), in addition to the other consequences and remedies set forth herein, Service Provider shall pay to KN an amount equal to $10,000 for each Contact between Service Provider and an End User that occurs outside the Exchange (i.e., without payment of a fee by End User to KN). The Parties hereby agree that the foregoing liquidated damage amount is a reasonable estimate of the actual damages KN may suffer as a result of each breach of this Section 3.4 and/or the policy on Contacts Outside the Exchange.<br/>
3.5	Service Provider Obligations.  <br/>
3.5.1	General Responsibilities. Service Provider is responsible for (i) uploading information regarding Service Provider to the Exchange once KN has approved such Service Provider information for uploading; (ii) maintaining at all times a current privacy statement that is available on Service Provider’s website which details KN’s collection, processing, storage, handling and transmission of End User’s data, including KN’s use, collection, processing, storage, handling and transmission of such data; (iii) providing Services and support to End Users in a professional and workmanlike manner; (iv) maintaining industry standard and reasonable security mechanisms with respect to the issuance of End User credentials and authentication necessary to access the Services, and the protection of any other personal information transmitted to or through, stored on, published or otherwise made available to, or disseminated by the Service Provider; (v) obtaining any necessary consents from End Users and any other authorized third parties with respect to the collection, processing, storage, handling and transmission of their data or any other Confidential Information; (vi) using the Exchange only for the purposes set out in this Agreement and any applicable laws, regulations or generally accepted practices or guidelines; (vii) using Service Provider’s reasonable best efforts to provide all Services to End Users with utmost professionalism and completing all Services in the manner agreed upon between End User and Service Provider; (viii) resolving any and all disputes that may arise between End User and Service Provider regarding any Services; and (ix) maintaining all permits and licenses required by Service Provider in order to provide the Services under applicable law and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including relevant data privacy and data security laws. <br/>

KN is also hereby authorized to collect and publish reviews and usage data and metrics related to Service Provider and the Services. Only End Users who make a bona fide Contact with a Service Provider will be able to rate and review the Service Provider on the Exchange.  Service Provider ratings may be used to determine the placement of Service Provider on the Exchange.  KN reserves the right to display Service Provider to End Users in the Platform in a manner that will be determined at KN’s sole discretion. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, KN may list certain carriers and drayage service providers with greater prominence than the Service Provider in exchange for fees additional compensation paid by such other service providers or based on a higher End User rating for such other service providers.  In addition, KN may include advertisements on the Exchange (with placement of such advertisements determined by KN in its sole and absolute discretion), including in close proximity to information about Service Provider set forth on the Exchange, in exchange for compensation.  Service Provider and the Services may be subject to End User ratings to which Service Provider may not agree.  Service Provider shall have no recourse whatsoever against KN or any of its Affiliates in connection with End User ratings.<br/>
3.5.4	End Users. Service Provider is responsible for all interactions between Service Provider and End Users regarding the Services and for ensuring that all Services are delivered in compliance with all applicable laws.  Service Provider may submit its terms and conditions for its Services to KN for listing on the Exchange and require End Users to accept such terms and conditions prior to accepting Services from Service Provider.  Service Provider’s terms and conditions shall be consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

KN does not provide any support services to End Users.  Service Provider shall submit its terms and conditions for KN’s review as part of the approval process, and any updates must be submitted to KN for further approval.  Service Provider’s terms and conditions must not make any representations or warranties about KN, the Exchange, the Platform, any products or services of KN, or bind (or purport to bind) KN in any way.  All such terms and conditions must provide that KN is a third party beneficiary with respect to the enforcement of End User’s use of the Exchange and the Services in compliance with the requirements in this Agreement.<br/>
